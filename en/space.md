# The space

The Heart of Code space is located in the former [Bethanien](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethanien_(Berlin)) hospital in the [NewYorck](https://www.newyorck.net/) in Kreuzberg. The NewYorck is a space for emancipatory projects and us belongs one of the rooms in its hallway. The NewYorck is located in the south wing of the Bethanien. Unfortunately, our space is quite difficult to find. Before your first visit, be sure to read the detailed [directions](#directions) below! Further down you will also find important information about the [barriers](#barriers) of our space. Please note that very large events may also take place in other rooms at the NewYorck. However, we should be easier to find in those rooms.

Address:

- Mariannenplatz 2A (aka Marielle-Franco-Platz 2A), 10997 Berlin-Kreuzberg

We have entries in the following maps (only a very rough location):

## Furnishing

We have: a sofa, table with chairs, Wi-Fi (freifunk), electricity, a 3D printer, a small library, and a [Blåhaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C3%A5haj) 🏳️‍⚧️

Toilets are located very close by in the NewYorck.

## Directions

The entrance to NewYorck is somewhat hidden on the south wing of the Bethanien. The exact location of the entrance is [here (OpenStreetMap)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.503470&mlon=13.423879#map=19/52.503470/13.423879) or at the coordinates [52.503433,13.423572](geo:52.503433,13.423572?z=19). The entrance is also marked with a purple circle on this satellite image:

The door is located in the corner, is fairly inconspicuous, and is usually only held open by a stone.

From the entrance, there is one short and two long flights of stairs leading up to the first floor. There, go through the door into a smaller room and then left through a white door into the long hallway of the NewYorck. Go to the very end of the hallway, past the restrooms on the right, then turn right through a door (also labeled Heart of Code) into an room with a blackboard. 

**Important:** This is not our room. Our room is behind the door straight ahead! 

Sometimes other groups meet up in the room infront of ours while we also have an event. Don't let that put you off, just pop in briefly and come to us in the back room \:)

This visualization illustrates it best:

## Barriers

Unfortunately, NewYorck and therefore our room is only accessible via stairs. Level access for visitors with limited mobility is therefore not possible at this time. 

There are also no guide strips or similar features. However, we are happy to accompany people with visual impairments to our room. Just let us [know](/en/contact.md) in advance!
