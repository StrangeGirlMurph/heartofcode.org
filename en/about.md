# About us

Liberté - Digitalité - Sœurité

The Heart of Code [e.V.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_association_(Germany)) is a non-profit public association aimed at all [FLINTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLINTA*) PyLadies, RailsGirls, JavaLassies, 3D fairies, gamers, Arduinas, network mermaids, soldering brats, RaspberryRabauk\*innen, and anyone else interested in bits, bytes, and tinkering. It is a place to tinker together, get creative, geek out, hack, hang out, get to know each other, and enjoy other cultural activities – for more networking, more community, and above all, of course: more hacking. There are various meetings, open learning and working groups, hack days, and more. Almost anything is possible if you feel like it. For example, on topics such as Python, data visualization, 3D printing, IT security, cycle tracking apps, Java, hardware, and anyhing that twinkles. It should just be fun and non-commercial. If you want to present code or an educational comic about vulvas, perform something on the theremin, recommend trashy hacker movies from the 80s, or just nerd out with like-minded people, come on by.

We want to make it easier for women, lesbians, inter, non-binary, trans, and agender people to access technologies, tools, and content to make the hacking community and tech landscape more diverse in the long term.Heart of Code is intended to complement the already diverse and colorful hackspace landscape and initiatives in Berlin. We have been around since 2017. There is no master plan and no president. Heart of Code is just one idea among many possibilities. We are jumping into a big gap that we cannot fill on our own. We look forward to collaborations, partnerships, cooperation, and happy cooperation.

Heart of Code is our contribution to a colorful future.
